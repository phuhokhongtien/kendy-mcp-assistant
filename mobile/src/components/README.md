# Components

This directory contains reusable React Native components.

## Structure

Organize components by feature or type:
- Common UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- Feature-specific components
- Layout components

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for props
- Include component documentation
- Write unit tests for components
