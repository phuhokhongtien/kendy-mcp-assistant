## üìù Coding Standards

### General Principles

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use template literals for string interpolation

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons consistently
- Use single quotes for strings (except in JSX)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays

### File Organization

- One component per file
- Group related files in directories
- Use index files for clean imports
- Keep file names descriptive and consistent
